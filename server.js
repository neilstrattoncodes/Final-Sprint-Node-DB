// This code is setting up an Express.js web server. It configures the "view engine" to use Embedded JavaScript (EJS) templates, sets up the server to use the Morgan HTTP request logger in "dev" mode if the DEBUG flag is set to true, sets up the server to serve static files from the "public" directory, configures the server to parse URL-encoded and JSON-encoded request bodies, configures the server to use the flash middleware for displaying messages, configures the server to use the session middleware for managing sessions, initializes the Passport.js authentication middleware and configures it to use sessions, and sets up the methodOverride middleware to allow clients to use HTTP methods other than GET and POST by overriding the _method query parameter. Additionally, if the DEBUG flag is set to true, it sets up a middleware that logs the req.session object to the console on each request.

// Sets up the Morgan HTTP request logger middleware to log requests to the server in "dev" mode if the DEBUG flag is set to true. When the logger is in "dev" mode, it will produce detailed logs of each request, including the request method, URL, response status, and response time. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the server.

// Sets up the Express.js static middleware to serve static files from the "public" directory. This allows the server to serve files such as images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript files from the specified directory.

// Sets up the Express.js urlencoded middleware to parse URL-encoded request bodies. This middleware is typically used to parse the data in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format, which is often used to submit HTML form data. When a client sends an HTTP request with a URL-encoded request body, the middleware will parse the body and make the data available in the request.body object. The { extended: true } option is used to enable the use of the qs library to parse the request body, which allows for more advanced parsing options.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Sets up the flash middleware for the Express.js app. The flash middleware allows messages to be stored in the session and displayed on the next request. This is often used to display success or error messages after form submission. To use the flash middleware, a message can be set in the session using req.flash(key, value), where key is the name of the message and value is the message itself. 
app.use(flash());

// Sets up the session middleware for the Express.js app. The session middleware allows the server to store data in the session and make it available on subsequent requests. This is often used to store user authentication information or other data that needs to persist across requests. The session middleware requires a secret to sign the session ID cookie, which is provided as the value of the SESSION_SECRET environment variable. The resave and saveUninitialized options are set to false to prevent the session from being automatically saved to the session store. The cookie option is used to configure the session ID cookie, such as setting its maximum age to 900000 milliseconds (15 minutes).

// This code sets up the Passport.js authentication middleware for the Express.js app. The passport.initialize() middleware is used to initialize Passport and restore authentication state from the session.

The methodOverride middleware is used to allow clients to use HTTP methods other than GET and POST by overriding the _method query parameter. For example, a client could use a POST request with the _method parameter set to DELETE to simulate a DELETE request. This can be useful for working around the limitations of HTML forms, which only support GET and POST methods.

// This code is defining routes for an Express.js web server. It sets up two routes that use imported routers to handle requests to the /search and /auth paths.

It then defines a route that displays all movies from MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases on the "home" page. It also defines two routes that return the data for all movies in the MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, respectively.

This route requires the client to be authenticated, as indicated by the checkAuthenticated middleware. It also defines a route that displays the details of a movie with a given ID from the MongoDB database.

The app.use() method sets up a route that will match any request path that starts with the specified path. This means that requests to paths such as /search/foo, /search/bar, and /search/baz will all be handled by the searchRouter and requests to paths such as /auth/foo, /auth/bar, and /auth/baz will all be handled by the authRouter. This allows the main app to delegate requests to these paths to the imported routers, which can contain their own route definitions and middleware. This can help to organize the app's route handlers and make the code easier to maintain.

// This code sets up a listener for the Express.js app that will start the server and listen for incoming requests on the specified port. The listener uses the async keyword to define an asynchronous function that will be called when the server starts. The function first imports a module named mongo.db.config and uses it to connect to a MongoDB server. If the connection is successful, it exports the movies and usersData collections to the global scope using global.movies and global.usersData, respectively. It then logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running and listening on the specified port. If the connection to the MongoDB server fails, it logs the error to the console.
